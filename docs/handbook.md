# GoSheffield handbook

This document contains general information to help run GoSheffield.

### Treasury

Tasks to do every month:

* Invoice sponsors that need to be renewed
* Reimburse speakers who have provided receipts
* Order pizza and take care of expenses
* Keep the finances spreadsheet up to date with the bank account

Things to keep in mind:

* Be on the lookout for new sponsors and venues
* Ensure that the meetup is financially stable in the long term

### Social Media

Tasks to do every month:

* Tweet about upcoming meetups: when announced, 1 week prior, and a day prior
* Tweet as the meetup begins and ends, thanking and @-mentioning the sponsors
* Tweet a picture of each speaker with their username and topic

Things to keep in mind:

* Maintain a consistent writing style: enthusiastic, third person, emojis
* Ensure that the Twitter feed doesn't go silent for too long

### Speakers

Tasks to do every month:

* Find speakers for every meetup; at least 1-2 required to announce
* Ensure all speakers know they have 15 minutes, and provide a short title
* Talk to attendees at the meetups, to encourage them to give talks
* Follow up with people who said they'd do a talk "in a few months"
* Ensure that all meetup speakers remember about their talk and can make it

Things to keep in mind:

* Maintain a web form to receive talk applications
* Tweet about the form and talk slots periodically, roughly once per month

### Event running

Tasks to do every month:

* Coordinate the event with the venue: schedule, seats, media setup.
* Announce meetups ~45 days in advance, to always have one meetup published
* Prepare the MC slides to use at the meetup, which also introduce the talks
* Ensure that the meetup is on schedule for the pizza and the closing time
* Time all speakers for 15m, giving them a notice when they have 3m left

Things to keep in mind:

* The MC should talk for as little as possible; 5min max before the first talk
* Sponsors only get ~30s to present themselves, to keep things moving
* It's okay if a talk runs over by a minute or two, but not five.
* Questions are part of the allocated time; make that clear and time it too.
