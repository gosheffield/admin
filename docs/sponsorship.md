# GoSheffield Event Sponsorship

This document contains information for sponsors and potential sponsors of GoSheffield events.

## Benefits

- Up to two slides in our main slide deck. You can either send us your completed slides, or 
send us your content and we'll create them.
- We'll talk about your company for up to 30 seconds, whilst showing your slides. You can use 
this opportunity to talk about open positions, upcoming events, etc.
- Your company logo on slides. Your logo is present on the first and last slide in our deck 
(these generally have the longest screen time).
- Your company mentioned on every meetup.com event which you sponsor.
- Your company Twitter account mentioned in Tweets from our account before and after the 
sponsored event.

We recognise that without sponsorships GoSheffield would not be possible. As such, suggestions 
and feedback are very much welcome.

Anywhere we mention sponsors (on meetup.com, in our slides, etc) the order will be longest 
sponsorship first.
