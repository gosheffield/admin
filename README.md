### Summary

GoSheffield is a non-profit monthly meetup in Sheffield about the [Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/). Organised by the local community, we focus on short technical talks and fostering the growth of Go in the area. We provide opportunities to find or fill Go-related jobs.

We endeavour to create a diverse and inclusive community. As such all attendees, organisers and sponsors are required to follow the community [code of conduct](https://golang.org/conduct).
